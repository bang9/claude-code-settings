description: Systematic problem-solving workflow for bug fixes and feature implementations. Use when debugging issues, fixing bugs, implementing features, or when the user describes unexpected behavior, errors, or needs a methodical approach to code changes. Ensures reproducible verification and validates solutions are fundamental fixes rather than workarounds.

# Problem Solver

A structured workflow for solving problems through iterative planning, reproduction, implementation, and validation.

## When This Skill Activates

- User describes a bug or unexpected behavior
- User requests a feature implementation
- User mentions "fix", "debug", "implement", "solve", or "issue"
- Complex code changes requiring systematic approach

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 0: Input Collection
    ↓
Phase 1: First-Pass Planning & Execution
    ↓ (iterate until solved)
Phase 2: Solution Validation
    ↓
    ├─→ Fundamental Fix → Complete
    └─→ Workaround → Return to Phase 1
```

## Phase 0: Input Collection

### Required Information Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Scope**: Files, directories, components involved
- [ ] **Resources**: Available tools, MCP servers, test commands
- [ ] **Expected behavior**: What should happen
- [ ] **Actual behavior**: What is happening instead
- [ ] **Reproduction steps**: How to trigger the issue (if known)

### Clarification Protocol

If any required information is unclear or ambiguous:

1. **Stop and ask** - Do not assume or guess
2. **Be specific** - Ask targeted questions, not open-ended ones
3. **Confirm understanding** - Restate the problem before proceeding

> Use AskUserQuestion tool when clarification is needed.

## Phase 1: First-Pass Planning & Execution

### Step 1.1: Requirements Definition

1. List all requirements as bullet points
2. Identify any ambiguous terms or conditions
3. Ask clarifying questions if needed
4. Get user confirmation before proceeding

### Step 1.2: Information Gathering

1. **Locate relevant code** using Grep, Glob, Read
2. **Trace data flow** from input to output
3. **Identify dependencies** and side effects
4. **Document findings** for reference

### Step 1.3: Reproduction Environment (Critical)

Establish a verifiable reproduction **before** making changes.

Choose appropriate method(s) based on the problem type. Combine as needed:

| Problem Type | Method | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Logic bugs, calculations | Test code | Unit test that fails with current bug |
| UI rendering, interactions | Mock data + UI | Storybook, dev server with fixture data |
| Timing, state, intermittent | Logging | Console logs at key execution points |

> Methods are not mutually exclusive. For example, UI bugs may benefit from mock data + logging together, or a complex state bug might need all three approaches.

**Verification checkpoint**: Can you reliably trigger the issue?

### Step 1.4: Implementation

1. Create task list with TodoWrite
2. Implement in small, testable increments
3. Run verification after each change
4. Document any deviations from plan

### Step 1.5: Verification

- [ ] Issue no longer reproduces in test environment
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Edge cases considered and handled
- [ ] No new warnings or errors introduced

---

## Phase 2: Solution Validation

### Analysis Questions

Answer each question honestly:

1. **Root cause addressed?** Does this fix the underlying cause, or mask symptoms?
2. **Recurrence risk?** Could similar inputs cause the same problem?
3. **Side effects?** Are other parts of the system affected?
4. **Code quality?** Is the solution clean and maintainable?

### Decision Matrix

| Indicator | Fundamental Fix | Workaround |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Addresses root cause | Yes | No |
| Similar cases handled | Yes | No |
| Code feels natural | Yes | Feels forced |
| Future-proof | Yes | Fragile |

### If Workaround Detected

1. **Document** why current approach is a workaround
2. **Identify** what a fundamental fix would require
3. **Return to Phase 1** with new approach
4. **Repeat** until fundamental fix achieved

---

## Completion Criteria

All must be true:

- [ ] Problem verified as resolved
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Solution validated as fundamental (not workaround)
- [ ] Changes documented/committed appropriately
